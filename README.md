# Alternate Realty: Spring Boot Backend

Personal foray into Spring Boot over winter break. On the off chance it works out better for the project over Express,
it's here to swap in!

## Key Features/Strengths

**In-line request validation**

Spring Boot automatically parses HTTP request parameters and bodies into corresponding Java objects. Parameter
validation can be added inline with the controller and body validation can be added directly in the related class.
